# MCP AI Agent Implementation Tracker

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation progress of the MCP AI Agent feature. The agent will allow users to interact with MCP servers through the chat interface, with command approval workflows and result display.

## Core Objectives
1. Create an intelligent AI agent that integrates seamlessly with the user's configured MCP servers
2. Analyze user requests to determine when MCP tools would be helpful
3. Generate appropriate MCP commands based on user intent
4. Provide a transparent approval workflow for commands
5. Display results in a user-friendly manner

  - Provide clear explanations of command purpose
  - Include option to cancel command execution

### Phase 6: Results Display and Error Handling ‚è≥
- [x] **Implement result parsing and display**
  - Parse different result types from MCP server
  - Format and display results in chat interface
  - Handle multi-format results (text, JSON, etc.)
  - Include contextual information with results

- [ ] **Develop robust error handling**
  - Create user-friendly error messages
  - Suggest recovery actions for common errors
  - Implement automatic retry logic where appropriate
  - Provide detailed logs for troubleshooting

## Technical Requirements

### Connection Flow
1. Toggle activates agent mode
2. System retrieves user's MCP connections from database
3. User selects desired MCP server from existing connections
4. Agent establishes connections to MCP endpoints:
   - `/info` - For server metadata
   - `/tools` - For discovering available tools
   - `/messages` - For sending commands
   - `/sse` - For receiving real-time updates
5. Agent analyzes user messages and generates appropriate commands
6. User approves commands before execution
7. Agent displays results in chat interface

### Database Integration
- Use the user_mcp_server_configurations table for server information
- Key fields to utilize:
  - id (UUID): Primary identifier
  - user_id (UUID): Link to user account
  - mcp_nickname: Human-readable server name
  - mcp_host: Server hostname or IP
  - mcp_port: Server port number
  - mcp_connection_status: Current connection state
  - mcp_last_error_message: Latest error information
  - mcp_discovered_tools_schema: JSON schema of available tools
  - is_default: Boolean indicating preferred server
  - created_at/updated_at: Tracking timestamps

### MCP Protocol Requirements
- SSE Connection: Establish Server-Sent Events connection to /sse endpoint
- Tool Discovery: Fetch available tools from /tools endpoint
- Command Invocation: Send commands to /messages endpoint
- Result Handling: Process tool_result and error messages from SSE stream

### AI Integration
- Leverage existing AI model infrastructure for:
  - Command generation based on user intent
  - Tool selection based on request analysis
  - Result interpretation and explanation
  - Learning from user interactions

## User Experience Considerations

### Activation Experience
- Toggle should be clearly visible in chat interface
- Status indicators should show current state (connected/disconnected)
- Provide feedback during connection process
- Show helpful messages when no connections are configured

### Server Selection Experience
- Default to previously selected server when available
- Clearly indicate connection status with visual cues
- Provide guidance if no servers are configured
- Remember user preferences across sessions

### Command Approval Experience
