## Current Status

The project is in the early development phase. The foundational architecture is in place, including the basic frontend and backend structure. The authentication system is functional but basic, and core UI components have been implemented. A significant milestone was reached with the migration from SQLite to PostgreSQL for all environments. The project vision has expanded to encompass an AI agentic platform for chip design professionals, with a comprehensive plan for future phases.

**Current Focus**: 
- Building out the user management interface and connecting it to the backend API
- Optimizing PostgreSQL integration and performance
- Planning initial AI and chat interface components

**Timeline**:
- Phase 1 (Core Authentication): ✓ Completed
- Phase 1.5 (Database Migration): ✓ Completed
- Phase 2 (User Management): In Progress (40%)
- Phase 3 (AI Integration): Planning Stage
- Phase 4 (Agent Capabilities): Future Phase
- Phase 5 (Chip Design Specialization): Future Phase
- Phase 6 (Learning & Improvement): Future Phase

## Known Issues

1. **Authentication**
   - Session timeout handling needs improvement
   - Password reset functionality not implemented
   - No multi-factor authentication option

2. **Performance**
   - Initial page load could be optimized
   - Backend API response times vary under load
   - No caching strategy implemented yet
   - Some queries need optimization for PostgreSQL

3. **User Interface**
   - Mobile responsiveness needs refinement on some views
   - Form validation feedback could be improved
   - Some UI components lack loading states

4. **Backend**
   - Error handling is inconsistent across endpoints
   - Database queries need optimization for PostgreSQL
   - Missing input validation on some endpoints
   - Connection pooling not yet configured optimally

5. **Development Workflow**
   - Test coverage is minimal
   - CI/CD pipeline not set up
   - Documentation is incomplete
   - Database migration scripts need refinement

6. **Future Requirements**
   - Secure execution environment needs detailed design
   - Knowledge base schema requires domain expertise input
   - Integration with Ollama needs API exploration
   - Permission model for command execution needs refinement

## Priority Tasks

1. Complete user management CRUD operations
2. Implement improved error handling on the backend
3. Add loading states to UI components
4. Optimize PostgreSQL queries for better performance
5. Set up basic unit tests for core functionality
6. Configure connection pooling for PostgreSQL
7. Begin chat interface component design
8. Research Ollama API integration requirements
