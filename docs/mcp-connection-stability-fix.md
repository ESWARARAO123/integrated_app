# MCP Connection Stability Fix

## Problem Description

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) connection was experiencing automatic disconnections after a few seconds of successful connection. Users would toggle the MCP switch, see it connect successfully, but then it would disconnect automatically without user intervention.

## Root Cause Analysis

After analyzing the logs and code, I identified several issues causing the instability:

### 1. **Aggressive useEffect Dependencies**
The main `useEffect` hook in `MCPContext.tsx` had `error` in its dependency array:
```typescript
}, [isMCPEnabled, defaultServer, availableServers, error]);
```

This caused the effect to re-run whenever any error occurred, potentially triggering disconnections.

### 2. **Aggressive Connection Verification**
The `verifyConnection()` function was trying to execute an `echo` command to verify connections:
```typescript
executeCommand('echo', { text: 'connection_test' })
```

If the MCP server didn't have an `echo` tool (which is common), this would fail and trigger a disconnection.

### 3. **Rapid Connect/Disconnect Cycles**
There was no protection against rapid connection state changes, leading to unstable behavior.

### 4. **Missing Connection State Checks**
The connection logic didn't properly check if a connection was already established before attempting new connections.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Fixed useEffect Dependencies**
```typescript
// Before
}, [isMCPEnabled, defaultServer, availableServers, error]);

// After  
}, [isMCPEnabled, defaultServer, availableServers]); // Removed 'error'
```

### 2. **Improved Connection Verification**
```typescript
// Before: Aggressive command execution
executeCommand('echo', { text: 'connection_test' })

// After: Gentle tools fetching
fetchServerTools(defaultServer)
  .then(tools => {
    console.log(`Connection verification successful: ${tools.length} tools available`);
    // Don't disconnect on failure, just log warning
  })
```

### 3. **Added Connection Stability Tracking**
```typescript
const connectionStabilityRef = useRef<{
  lastConnectedTime: number;
  disconnectionCount: number;
}>({ lastConnectedTime: 0, disconnectionCount: 0 });
```

### 4. **Prevented Rapid Disconnections**
```typescript
// Only process disconnection if it's been more than 5 seconds since connection
if (timeSinceLastConnection > 5000) {
  // Process disconnection
} else {
  console.log('Ignoring rapid disconnection');
}
```

### 5. **Added Connection State Checks**
```typescript
if (isMCPEnabled && defaultServer) {
  // Only connect if we're not already connected or connecting
  if (mcpConnection.status !== 'connected' && mcpConnection.status !== 'connecting') {
    connectToServer(defaultServer);
  }
}
```

### 6. **Enhanced Logging**
Added comprehensive logging with `[MCP-CONTEXT]` prefix to track connection state changes:
- Connection attempts
- State transitions
- Error conditions
- Disconnection events

## Key Changes Made

### File: `client/src/contexts/MCPContext.tsx`

1. **Line 311**: Removed `error` from useEffect dependencies
2. **Line 106-109**: Added connection stability tracking
3. **Line 177-216**: Enhanced connection listener with stability tracking
4. **Line 250-275**: Improved disconnection handling with rapid-change protection
5. **Line 387-391**: Added logging to state persistence
6. **Line 741-754**: Enhanced toggle function with logging
7. **Line 376-402**: Replaced aggressive connection verification with gentle approach
8. **Line 313-360**: Improved connection restoration logic

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Stable Connections**: MCP connections should remain stable once established
2. **No Rapid Disconnections**: Protection against connect/disconnect cycles
3. **Better Error Handling**: Failures don't immediately trigger disconnections
4. **Improved Logging**: Clear visibility into connection state changes
5. **Graceful Recovery**: Better handling of temporary network issues

## Testing the Fix

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Enable MCP Toggle**:
   - Toggle MCP switch ON
   - Verify connection establishes
   - Wait 30+ seconds to ensure stability

2. **Check Browser Console**:
   - Look for `[MCP-CONTEXT]` log messages
   - Verify no rapid connect/disconnect cycles
   - Check for successful clientId acquisition

3. **Test Reconnection**:
   - Refresh the page
   - Verify connection restores from localStorage
   - Check stability after restoration

4. **Test Disable/Enable**:
   - Toggle MCP OFF
   - Toggle MCP ON again
   - Verify clean reconnection

### Expected Log Messages

```
[MCP-CONTEXT] Toggling MCP enabled state: false -> true
[MCP-CONTEXT] useEffect triggered - isMCPEnabled: true, defaultServer: 172.16.16.54
[MCP-CONTEXT] Connecting to server because MCP is enabled and we have a default server
[MCP-CONTEXT] Received MCP connected message: {connectionId: "...", clientId: "..."}
[MCP-CONTEXT] Successfully connected with clientId: 1749582441161
```

## Monitoring

To monitor the fix effectiveness:

1. **Check for Stability**: Connections should last indefinitely unless manually disconnected
2. **Monitor Logs**: No unexpected disconnection messages
3. **User Experience**: Smooth MCP toggle behavior without automatic resets
4. **Performance**: No excessive reconnection attempts

## Rollback Plan

If issues persist, the changes can be reverted by:
1. Restoring the original `useEffect` dependencies
2. Reverting the connection verification to command execution
3. Removing the stability tracking logic

However, the implemented changes are conservative and should improve stability without breaking existing functionality.
