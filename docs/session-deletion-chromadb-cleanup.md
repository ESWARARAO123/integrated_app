# Session Deletion with ChromaDB Cleanup

## Overview

This implementation ensures that when a chat session is deleted, all associated ChromaDB collections are properly cleaned up to prevent duplicate collections and maintain data hygiene. The system provides user isolation and automatically wipes all collections when a user has no remaining sessions.

## Key Features

### 1. **Session-Specific Cleanup**
- Deletes both text and image ChromaDB data for the specific session
- Maintains user isolation (only affects the user's own data)
- Handles both successful and failed deletion scenarios gracefully

### 2. **Complete Collection Wipe**
- Automatically detects when a user has no remaining chat sessions
- Completely removes all user collections (both text and image) from ChromaDB
- Prevents accumulation of orphaned collections

### 3. **User Isolation**
- All operations are user-specific using the pattern `user_{userId}_docs` and `user_{userId}_images`
- No cross-user data contamination
- Safe concurrent operations for multiple users

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Enhanced VectorStoreService (`src/services/vectorStoreService.js`)

**New Methods Added:**

```javascript
// Delete session-specific image data
async deleteSessionImageData(sessionId, userId)

// Delete all user collections (text + images)
async deleteUserCollections(userId)

// Check if user has any remaining data
async userHasData(userId)
```

#### 2. Updated Session Deletion Route (`src/routes/chatbot.js`)

**Enhanced Deletion Flow:**
1. Verify session ownership
2. Delete ChromaDB text data for session
3. Delete ChromaDB image data for session
4. Delete session from database
5. Check remaining sessions count
6. If no sessions remain ‚Üí wipe all user collections

#### 3. Enhanced RAG Data Deletion (`src/routes/ollama.js`)

**Updated to handle both text and image data:**
- Deletes session data from both text and image collections
- Provides detailed feedback on deletion results
- Reports total chunks deleted

### Frontend Integration

The existing frontend deletion flow automatically benefits from these changes:

```typescript
// In useChatSessions.ts - deleteSession function
await chatbotService.deleteSession(sessionId);
await ragChatService.clearRagData(sessionId); // Now handles both text and images
```

## Collection Naming Convention

- **Text Collections**: `user_{userId}_docs`
- **Image Collections**: `user_{userId}_images`
- **User ID Format**: UUIDs with hyphens replaced by underscores

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation
- Session deletion continues even if ChromaDB cleanup fails
- Partial failures are logged but don't block the operation
- Non-existent collections are treated as successful deletions

### Logging
- Comprehensive logging for all deletion operations
- Clear success/failure indicators
- Detailed chunk count reporting

## Testing

### Test Script
Run the test script to verify functionality:

```bash
node scripts/test_session_deletion.js
```

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Setup Test Data**
   ```bash
   # Upload documents to create collections
   # Note the user ID and session ID from logs
   ```

2. **Test Session Deletion**
   ```bash
   # Delete a session via the UI
   # Check logs for ChromaDB cleanup messages
   ```

3. **Test Complete Wipe**
   ```bash
   # Delete all sessions for a user
   # Verify collections are completely removed
   ```

## Monitoring

### Key Log Messages

**Session Deletion:**
```
üóëÔ∏è Starting deletion process for session {sessionId} (user: {userId})
üóëÔ∏è Deleting ChromaDB text data for session...
üóëÔ∏è Deleting ChromaDB image data for session...
‚úÖ Session {sessionId} deleted from database
```

**Collection Wipe:**
```
üßπ No sessions remaining for user {userId}, wiping all ChromaDB collections...
‚úÖ Successfully wiped all collections for user {userId}
```

### Metrics to Monitor

- **Deletion Success Rate**: Track successful vs failed deletions
- **Orphaned Collections**: Monitor for collections without corresponding sessions
- **Performance**: Track deletion operation duration
- **Storage Cleanup**: Monitor ChromaDB storage usage reduction

## Benefits

### 1. **Data Hygiene**
- No orphaned collections
- Clean ChromaDB storage
- Predictable collection lifecycle

### 2. **Performance**
- Faster queries due to smaller collections
- Reduced memory usage
- Better ChromaDB performance

### 3. **User Experience**
- Clean slate when starting fresh
- No confusion from old data
- Consistent behavior across sessions

### 4. **Maintenance**
- Automatic cleanup reduces manual intervention
- Clear audit trail through logging
- Easy troubleshooting with detailed error messages

## Security Considerations

### User Isolation
- All operations verify user ownership
- No cross-user data access possible
- Session verification before any deletion

### Data Protection
- Graceful handling of deletion failures
- No data loss from partial failures
- Comprehensive error logging for debugging

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Batch Operations**: Optimize for bulk session deletions
2. **Soft Deletion**: Implement recovery period before permanent deletion
3. **Analytics**: Track deletion patterns for insights
4. **Compression**: Archive old data instead of immediate deletion

### Configuration Options
- Configurable retention periods
- Optional manual confirmation for collection wipes
- Customizable cleanup schedules
