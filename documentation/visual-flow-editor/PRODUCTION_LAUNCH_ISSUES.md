## üèóÔ∏è Sprint 1 Issues (July 28 - August 11) - COMPLETED

### Issue #1: Implement Visual Flow Editor Foundation
**Priority**: Critical
**Effort**: 5 days
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Labels**: `feature`, `foundation`, `react-flow`

**Description**:
Create the basic visual flow editor with React Flow canvas, drag-and-drop nodes, and connection system.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] React Flow canvas with infinite pan/zoom
- [x] Three node types: Input, Process, Output
- [x] Drag and drop functionality from node palette
- [x] Visual connections between nodes
- [x] Basic theme integration (Dark/Light/Midnight)
- [x] Node configuration panels

**Implementation Notes**:
- Used React Flow v11 for canvas
- Created BaseNode, InputNode, ProcessNode, OutputNode components
- Integrated with existing theme system

---

### Issue #2: Fix Critical Save/Load System Bugs
**Priority**: Critical
**Effort**: 3 days
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Labels**: `bug`, `database`, `critical`

**Description**:
Multiple critical bugs in the save/load system were preventing proper flow persistence and causing data corruption.

**Bugs Fixed**:
- [x] **Save Bug**: Multiple saves were overwriting the same flow instead of creating new ones
- [x] **SQL Query Bug**: `GET /api/flows` was returning only one flow per user instead of all flows
- [x] **Authentication Bug**: JWT authentication pattern didn't match application standard (switched to session-based)
- [x] **Flow ID Management**: Fixed distinction between save (new) vs update (existing) operations

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Save logic was reusing existing flow IDs instead of generating new ones
- SQL query had incorrect LIMIT clause
- Authentication middleware mismatch with existing patterns
- Frontend state management confusion between create/update operations

---

### Issue #3: Resolve UI Regression and Node Styling Problems
**Priority**: Critical
**Effort**: 2 days
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Labels**: `bug`, `ui`, `regression`

**Description**:
Major UI regression after initial enhancements caused nodes to be "out of place" with "weird UI overlay glitch" and broken connection handles.

**Bugs Fixed**:
- [x] **Missing Connection Handles**: Input and Output nodes were missing connection handles
- [x] **React Flow CSS Glitch**: White overlay from React Flow default CSS
- [x] **Node Positioning**: Inconsistent positioning and drag interactions
- [x] **Styling Inconsistency**: Different styling between node types

**Technical Solution**:
- Added explicit Handle components to all node types
- Overrode React Flow default CSS causing white overlays
- Standardized node styling across all types
- Fixed drag interaction handlers
